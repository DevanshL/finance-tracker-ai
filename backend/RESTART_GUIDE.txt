BACKEND FIX - RESTART INSTRUCTIONS
===================================================

ISSUE FIXED:
The advancedSecurity.js middleware was blocking ALL requests with 403 "Access denied"
The ipFilter middleware was blocking all IPs in development mode.

SOLUTION APPLIED:
✓ Disabled ipFilter for development
✓ Disabled detectSuspiciousActivity for development
✓ Security headers and XSS protection still enabled
✓ Sanitization still active

TO APPLY FIXES:

1. RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER:
   Press Ctrl+C to stop the running server
   Then run: npm start

2. VERIFY IT WORKS:
   Run the test script: ./test-with-token.sh
   Or manually test: curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register

3. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
   ✓ Auth endpoints (register, login) - should work
   ✓ Protected endpoints (budgets, goals) - should return 401 without token
   ✓ Protected endpoints with valid token - should work
   ✓ Security headers still present (CSP, HSTS, etc)

4. TO RE-ENABLE SECURITY IN PRODUCTION:
   Uncomment the production code in middleware/advancedSecurity.js
   Lines ~82-98 for ipFilter
   Lines ~115-147 for detectSuspiciousActivity
